Welcome to this repository of Programming Merit Badge resources! Here you will find your counselor's teaching materials, sample code, and links to other resources that you can use to explore programming.

## About this Repository

This repo is maintained as a resource for Scouts BSA members working on the Programming Merit Badge with counselor Zach Colbert. It is made available under the terms of the GNU General Public License to all scouts working on their Programming Merit Badge, other merit badge counselors, and anyone who finds the content useful in their exploration of programming. The material here is based on a [similar repository](https://github.com/rbaker26/Programming-Merit-Badge) by Bob Baker, @rbaker26. Thanks, Bob!

The resources here are meant to be just that: resources. Programming is an incredibly vast and complex topic, and even an introductory class would take many more hours than we can afford for a merit badge class. By using the resources here and leaning on your counselor for support, you can learn enough to complete the requirements for the Programming Merit Badge.

## About the Maintainer

My name is Zach Colbert. I am an Eagle Scout out of Oregon Trail Council, with several years' experience as a camp staffer, OA officer, and assistant scoutmaster. As of the time this file was committed I am living in Portland, OR, and working as an IT professional.

In 2020 I earned a bachelor's degree from Oregon State University in computational physics, with a minor in computer science. During my time at OSU I became familiar with several programming languages:

- Python
- C and C++
- x86 Assembly
- Javascript
- Windows PowerShell
- Bash

I am also an information security and internet privacy nerd. We won't necessarily cover these topics when working on the Programming Merit Badge, but I'm happy to chat about these and anything technology-related to folks who are interested!

### A Note About Communication

If you are a scout and I am your merit badge counselor, I expect that we'll need to meet several times to talk about requirements, look at your work, and answer your questions. It's likely you'll have my email address and phone number written down after we meet for the first time. Please be aware that I **cannot** meet with you one-on-one, including emails and phone calls, with respect to the BSA's youth protection rules.

Please help me follow youth protection rules by:

- CC'ing your parent(s) or scoutmaster on emails.
- Asking your parent(s), scoutmaster, or other scouts to join us for phone calls and meetings.
- Letting me know in advance if your parent(s) or scoutmaster will be unable to join us for a meeting (I can help with this).
- Not sending me DMs on any social media platform.

## How to use this material

PowerPoints are great communication tools, but can be ineffective for small groups, under 6 scouts. If you are dealing with smaller groups, it may be a good idea to develop a more hands-on approach focused on the individual rather than the group.  
Also, be cognizant of the age of your group. Programming can be tailored to the age of scouts to better communicate the message. The easiest way to do this is by tailoring the languages used. I would suggest using the following teaching rubric broken down by age...

**Ages 10 - 11** (group 1)

- Python - Hello World
- Scratch - Temp Conversion
- HTML + JavaScript - Name Output

**Ages 11 - 14** (group 2)

- C++ - Hello World
- HTML + JavaScript - Temp Conversion
- Java - Calculate Area of Shapes

**Ages 14 - 16** (group 3)

- HTML + JavaScript - String Concatenation + Temp Conversion
- C++ - USD to MXN Conversion
- Java - Calculate Area of Advanced Shapes

**Ages 16 - 17** (group 4)

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript - Advanced Temp Conversion
- C++ - USD to multiple currencies
- C# - Calculate Area of Advanced Shapes w/ Menu

Not every counselor will be knowledgeable in all these languages and that is fine. If you are not knowledgeable in these languages, using you experience, try to substitute languages and problems to match difficulty and complexity outlined above.
The goal here is not inhibit the scout's learning with a language that is too complex or a problem that is too hard. On the other hand, older scouts may be bored by simpler languages and problem sets.  
It is important to tailor the material to match the scouts or else the scouts will not have a enjoyable experience.

## Need Help?

If you are a merit badge counselor and want some help tailoring this material into a lesson for your group of scouts, please reach out to me. I am willing to help with some aspects of planning and problem solving.

If you are a scout leader and would like me to teach a Programming Merit Badge class, you are welcome to ask. I can't promise I'll always be available to teach, but there's no harm in asking.
